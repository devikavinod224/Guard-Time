## Features

### **1. 24/7 Digital Guardian: Proactive Safety Monitoring**

Move beyond basic checks. Our suite offers a proactive, multi-layered safety net that operates around the clock.

*   **Live Screen View:** Mirror your child's active screen in real-time. See what they see, as they see it.
*   **Notification Sync:** Get parallel alerts for messages & activity from WhatsApp, Facebook, Snapchat, and other apps directly to your dashboard.
*   **Remote Environment Check:** Instantly activate the front or rear camera of your child's device for a safety check—anytime, anywhere.
*   **Ambient Audio Listen-In:** Hear the immediate surroundings through your child's device microphone with one-way audio streaming.
*   **Smart Content Scanner:** Define custom keywords. We'll scan social media and app content for harmful material and trigger instant alerts on detection.

### **2. Intelligent Location Awareness: More Than Just a Dot on a Map**

Transform location data into meaningful insight and automated safety boundaries.

*   **Live Location Pulse:** Watch your child's real-time position update dynamically on an interactive map.
*   **Timeline Travel Log:** Review a complete history of movements, retracing steps by hour, day, or week.
*   **Smart Geofencing:** Draw virtual boundaries (home, school, parks). Receive instant notifications for **"Arrival"** or **"Departure"** events.

### **3. Focus & Balance: Automated Time Management**

Foster healthy digital habits with intelligent, automated controls that manage access.

*   **App-Specific Limits:** Assign daily time allowances for distracting apps (social media, games, video streaming). Access halts when the limit is reached.

Everything you need is organized in one intuitive hub for effortless oversight.
